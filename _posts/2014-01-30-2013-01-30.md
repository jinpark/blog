Yesterday I went to a meetup called Obtaining, Scrubbing, and Exploring Data at the Command Line

It was just a mix of old and new things. The standard unix command line tools (cat, awk, grep, sed, less, head, tail, etc) and a mix of new tools (`csvkit` - a bunch of small command line tools for csv, `jq` - tools for handling json on the command line, `xml2json` and `json2csv` and others)

The speaker also got into a bit of his own tools. From something big like being able to call R from the command line to small bash functions that uses http://explainshell.com to print out what a shell function does on the command line.

He talked about creating “data science toolkits” and gave some examples of packaging and creating enviroments that can be easily moved around. [Here](http://datasciencetoolbox.com) is his example.

Here are the [slides](https://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/obtaining-scrubbing-exploring-data-command-line) from the talk.
