A list of anime that I enjoyed this decade. I started watching anime "seriously" (as its been airing) around 2013 or so. The list will be loosely split into genres but they will not be in any particular order. It'll probably be more biased towards the later part of 2010s because thats when I started having anime as my main form of entertainment. I'll keep updating this list I think...
