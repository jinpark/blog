I made a small vuejs project to showcase some shows I liked in 2017.

I glued together a few libraries and bashed together some code and it looks pretty nice! I did not use vue-router or even vuex. Just standard vue, some libraries and surge for deployment.

A few things I found,
1. `vue-test-utils` is very nice but unfinished. It makes it fairly difficult if not impossible to cleanly test your `mounted` functions.
2. `vue-cli` makes it rediculously easy to start a project. Its like `create-react-app` but you can still change your webpack configs!
3. Debugging is fairly easy with the vue chrome extension but not as easy as react.
4. Single file components with scoped css is awesome. 
5. There were a lot of fun anime this year!
