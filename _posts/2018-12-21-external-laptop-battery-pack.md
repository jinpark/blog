I just realized I wrote only 2 blog posts this year. :(

Lots of stuff's been happening in my life but not much tech related.

One thing that did happen was that I got a new laptop, Macbook Pro 15 2018 version. It's not bad but the battery is not great.

I sometimes dont have any outlets available to charge so I got a [large usb-c external battery](https://www.zmiusa.com/collections/portable-chargers-for-phones-tablets/products/20000-mah-duplex-quick-charge-portable-power-bank-battery-charger). 

The only problem with it was that I sometimes forgot it was plugged in and when I move the laptop, the battery flies away, causing damage to the usb c port on the laptop.

My simple solution was sticking on a 3M Hook and Loop (velcro) sticker on my laptop and the battery and sticking it on there.

It works very well and did not effect the hinge of the macbook at all, which I was a little worried about.
